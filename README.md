# expressive_cozmo_behaviors
This repository contains the source code for expressive behaviors for the Anki Cozmo Robot. These behaviors belong to eight categories: Active, Pleasant Active, Unpleasant Active, Inactive, Pleasant Inactive, Unpleasant Inactive, Pleasant, and Unpleasant. These categories were designed to spread evenly across Russell's circumplex model of affect. Each of these categories has four associated behaviors. In each category, there is a "Videos" folder and a "Python Codes" folder, which respectively contain the videos and Python scripts of the 4 Cozmo emotive actions. The behavior design and evaluation efforts are further described in an IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN) 2021 paper submission that is currently under review.
