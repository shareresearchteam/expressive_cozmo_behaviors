# expressive_cozmo_behaviors
This repository contains the source code for expressive behaviors for the Anki Cozmo Robot. These behaviors belong to eight categories: Active, Active Pleasant, Active Unpleasant, Inactive, Inactive Pleasant, Inactive Unpleasant, Pleasant, and Unpleasant. These categories were designed to spread evenly across Russell's circumplex model of affect. Each of these categories has four associated behaviors (and four corresponding Python scripts for Cozmo emotive animations). The behavior design and evaluation efforts are further described in an International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2021 paper submission that is currently under review.
